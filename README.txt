-This App allows a user to signup with their details, and then log in to the app.

-A user is created upon signup. Their details should be changable by settings, but
function is not currently working. A user should never be deleted.

-A Hoot is a created when you tap the Hoot Icon. You may then fill in the details
of your hoot, select a contact to send it to, and then e-mail them. You may also
edit your Hoots, or delete them by long pressing on one, then selecting each of the
Hoots you wish to delete.

-JSON was used for both User and Hoot storage.

-Permissions were set to be unobtrusive to user.

-User Experience was left with simple blue, and easy to spot buttons in plan area for
clearer use.

Developer Experience. References have been made to sources of labs and stack overflow
in many cases. Naming conventions have been choosen carefully to make them clear to
understand.
